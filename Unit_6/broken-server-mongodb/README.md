# Broken Server Challenge

### The Backstory

You were just hired as a Senior Developer for a Company called Nodemon Servers. You hosted your very first huddle and your team of developers handed you a HOT mess of code said they can't seem to get the server working.

- Clone Repo.
- Run npm install in the correct folder.
- We have provided an ENV file for you so you can proceed quicker.
- Run `nodemon` in your terminal
- Debug! - Use the Debug Terminal to help with your debugging skills.
- There are 7 main errors to find.

You will need to use the postman export provided for you (in the `Postman` folder) to test out every endpoint to make sure they are functioning. Some errors will only show up if you are using the endpoit.

Happy hacking!
