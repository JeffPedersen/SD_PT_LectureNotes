# React UI Libraries

React has a number of UI libraries that others have created to easily use with it.

These UI libraries function like Bootstrap did for our HTML. They usually provide different component structures with a prebuilt structure, styling, mobile responsiveness, and even minor component animations and transitions.

We will start with using one that is very approachable because it is a component library for and uses the styling of Bootstrap:

# Reactstrap

[Reactstrap Getting Started](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page)


## Installation

We need to install via the CLI (command line interface of the terminal) both Reactstrap and Bootstrap. It's easiest to follow their Getting Started page linked above. 

> We will want to keep this site open as we build components for our project and reference the docs just as we did when using Bootstrap.

## Navigating the Reactstrap Docs:
- The left side of the webpage houses the **sidebar navigation** which is key to looking through example components and tutorials.
- At the top of the left sidebar and underneath the reactstrap logo is a **search bar** which is incredibly useful to quickly find examples or use cases.
- Once a component is selected, the main section of the page will house the various example components.
- **To view the code for the component examples**: there is a small button in the lower right corner of each example labeled **"Show code"** that opens a copyable code block that creates the component.

> ## Props for Reactstrap Component Elements
> The properties that can be given or used by the elements used by the components are **displayed at the bottom** of each component page.
>
> Be sure to pay attention to any element/tag properties/attributes that may be customized in the example if you wish for your component to look the same. 
>
> Know that like with Bootstrap, you can add the custom properties from Bootstrap in order to customize it for the app. 
> 
> Ex: color="warning", color="success", outline, className="mb-2 text-muted"

# MUI

[Material UI Getting Started](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)

MUI was previously known as only Material UI. MUI is another component library for React that's highly customizable.

Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. Material UI is MUI's free React component library that is another wonderful and popular option.

## Installation 

We need to install via the CLI (command line interface of the terminal) like we did with Reactstrap. It's easiest to follow their Getting Started page linked above. 

Remember we are using NPM so follow the npm commands.

> **Tip**: Material UI also has amazing icon options. There is a separate package install 2/3rd's of the way down the page that I highly suggest! (They look fantastic.)

## Navigating the Material UI Docs:
- The left side of the webpage houses the **sidebar navigation** which is key to looking through example components and tutorials.
- The **top right of the page navbar** has the **search bar** to help you find whatever element/component directly.
- Once a component is selected from the **left sidebar navigation**, the main section of the page will house the various example components.
- **To view the code for the component examples**: there is a series small buttons below the displayed component(in the lower right corner). The first button **`<>`** opens a copyable code block that creates the component.

One of my favorite tutorials for how to use Material UI to create a mobile responsive and custom styled Material components is: [Material UI 5 (MUI) React Tutorial | MUI Responsive Real Project](https://youtu.be/fzxEECHnsvU) by Llama Dev on YouTube.

^ This demo is over an hour but will fully teach you how to use Material UI if it's a component library you're interested in learning!
