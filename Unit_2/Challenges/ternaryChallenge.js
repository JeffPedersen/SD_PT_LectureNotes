! Ternary Challenge: 
    Write a ternary that does the same thing as the age challenge
    If the age is 17 or younger, console.log 'Sorry, you're too young to do anything.'
    If the age is at least 18, console.log 'You can vote!'
    If the age is at least 21, console.log 'You can drink!'
    If the age is at least 25, console.log 'You can rent a car!'
    (Be sure to try the Else If challenge first and use that as a rubric! Much can be copy and pasted... ;] )

/* 
!   Bake Time Ternary Challenge:
    - Create two variables:
        - reqBakeTimeInMins: stores an integer
        - actBakeTimeInMins: stores an integer
        These values should be whole numbers and represent minutes.
            ie: 15, 30, 45 minutes
    
    - Write a ternary conditional that provides the following console logs:
        - If actBakeTimeInMins is equal to reqBakeTimeInMins
            "Remove from oven. It is done!"
        - If actBakeTImeInMIns is less than reqBakeTimeInMins
            "Still cooking..."
        - Else
            "It's burnt!"
*   Be sure to test the conditions based off different values within actBakeTimeInMins.
