/* 
?    Array Challenge 1:
    - Build an array of your favorite things (at least 4).
    - Use string interpolation to build a sentence that states all your favorite things using square bracket notation to grab the values.
    - This time, use the .forEach() method to console log "One of my favorite things is: " and the item for each item in the array.
*/

/* 
?   Array Challenge 2:
    - (Go look at MDN docs/use the Google to remind you of doing any of the following)
    - Create an array containing movie titles (at least 5)
    - Use .forEach() to list your movies
    - Add another movie at the end
    - Replace one of your existing movies with another one
*/

/* 
?   Array Challenge 3:
    - Remove the 5's from the given array.
    - Store the remaining numbers in a new variable and console.log that variable.

let myNumberArray = [3, 5, 7, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 2, 12, 5];

/* 
?   Array Challenge 4:
    - First check if you are working with an array
    - Using a method, flip the values within the array 
    (what was in index 4 is now in 0, 3 to 1, etc.)
    - Using a method, print the values of the newly arranged array
    
    hint: 
       - search something like "arrays", "javascript", "reverse"
       - look in your notes to see how we can check if something is an array
