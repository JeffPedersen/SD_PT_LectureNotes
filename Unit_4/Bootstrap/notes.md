# The Game Plan

We want to build a recipe app that will grab a random recipe as well as let us save our favorite ones for later.

What we'll need:

- index.html: the gateway to the browser/DOM
- style.css: for custom/additional styling
- main.js: for our JS
- an API with recipes: [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

Bonus:

- A CSS Framework/Styling Library: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

# To Do List

- [x] Create Base HTML, CSS, and JS files

- [x] Find BS components and add to HTML
- [ ] sign up for / look for API
- [ ] fetch random recipe
- [ ] use JS to dom manipulate create the bootstrap card

## Working with Bootstrap
- Created by Twitter
- A toolkit to help quickly build out a website
- Provides standard templates to various components such as:
    - Navbars
    - Progress Trackers
    - Forms, etc.
- Helps manage responsiveness for our page depending on what we use.
- Helps with keeping up with current design structures.

- a key way to quickly copy/paste components we need for sites

### How we connect and use BS

- Connect BS to project by following their "getting started" guide
    - [Getting started] https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
    - Connect CSS with link tag
