# Postman

An API client that allows us to create and read HTTP/s requests.

- A testing environment that helps us use client facing requests when we don't have a client side built out.
  - Usually a full stack app is built server first in small dev groups because the server determines what the data looks like/how it's structured
- Basically used as sudo front end to test our server endpoints and database connection.
- A way for us to test APIs

We will walk through making an API call with [HTTP Cats](https://http.cat/) or [HTTP Dog](https://http.dog/)
